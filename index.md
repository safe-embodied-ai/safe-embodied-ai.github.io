# Safe Embodied AI: Theory & Practice for Deployability in the Field Workshop @ RSS 2025
---
### **>Date:** TBD
### **Place:** University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California
---

## Introduction
Despite recent breakthroughs in embodied AI, ensuring the safety, robustness, and deployability of these systems in high-risk settings, such as field robotics, remains a critical challenge. This workshop will focus on safety considerations in outdoor, industrial, and high-stakes environments—characterized by uncertainty, open-world dynamics, and extreme conditions. Developing safe robotic methods requires interdisciplinary collaboration across diverse communities, including robotics, machine learning, statistics, control, human-robot interaction (HRI), and large models. This workshop aims to serve as a platform for fostering such collaboration, advancing both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of safe embodied AI in real-world deployments. Key topics will include uncertainty quantification in large robotic models, risk-aware decision-making, statistical safety guarantees, safe learning, and certifiable learning for field robotics. Additionally, the workshop will cover novel safety metrics, benchmarking methodologies, and the development of high-fidelity simulations to enhance the safety and reliability of field robotics.

Key topics include:
